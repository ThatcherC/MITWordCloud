# MITWordCloud
Gathers the messages left in the MIT Class of 2019 Guestbook.

I noticed that many of the messages had the same words - "excited", "congratulations", and "happy", so I thought it would be fun to make a word cloud of them.
Got to get all the words first though...
This program uses Python webscraping libraries to crawl through the full page of admittees and grab their messages.
